## Montecarlo Visual Loc

These two weeks I've been updating the Montecarlo Visual Loc exercise for future use. It was already 80% done by another person but they left around a year ago and I have to update it to the current Robotics Academy structure and finish it.

## Exercise overview

The things I had to update and change can be divided in 2 parts, or 2 repositories:

1. **Robotics Infrastructure**: It has the models and world used for the exercise. The previous developer had all models and textures done but over time they were lost, so I had to redo most of it.

2. **Robotics Academy**: Here the exercise itself is stored. The 2 things I had to update mainly were HAL.py and GUI.py, since they were outdated. Each exercise have these 2 files which provides the hardware abstraction layer for various components (HAL) and various base GUI's for easy development (GUI).

## Adding models

There are 2 models used in the exercise, stored in the Robotics Infrastructure repository. The house_int2_roof model, which is the same as the house_int2 model but with a roof added to the house and roombaROS_cam, which is the same model as roombaROS but with a camera sensor pointing up. Both of these models were lost with time and I had to create them again.

To create roombaROS_cam model, I just took the roombaROS model and added this to the laser link.

```bash
<sensor name="camera" type="camera">
  <pose>0 0 0 0 -1.57 0</pose>
  <visualize>true</visualize>
  <update_rate>10</update_rate>
  <camera>
    <horizontal_fov>1.089</horizontal_fov>
    <image>
      <format>R8G8B8</format>
      <width>640</width>
      <height>480</height>
    </image>
    <clip>
      <near>0.05</near>
      <far>8.0</far>
    </clip>
  </camera>
  <plugin name="camera_controller" filename="libgazebo_ros_camera.so">
    <frame_name>laser</frame_name>
  </plugin>
</sensor>
```

For the house_int2_roof model, after adding the roof I had to add textures to different parts of the roof because the robot needs different visuals in every room to know where it is at all times.
For that I divided the roof into different pieces for each room and changed the materials from Grey to different ones.

I also added some simple shapes working as ceiling lamps to have more visual differences.

## Updating HAL and GUI

The exercise is in the Robotics Academy repository, in exercises/static/exercises/name_of_the_exercise. It already had the hal.py and gui.py files but they were outdated. It was developed in ros 1 noetic and these 2 files were (inside the exercise folder) in python_template/ros1_noetic. I had to change it to python_template/ros2_humble. Then I updated both HAL and GUI files so the structure is the same to the ones in other exercises, using the gui_interfaces and hal_interfaces libraries, which are in the common folder in the same repository, the functions already implemented by the previous developer were already in other exercises in a more updated form so I just had to follow the structure of those functions.

## Future goals

Other stuff to be done for the exercise is adding more functions to GUI so the user experience is better and creating a dummy solution of the exercise to quickly test it.
