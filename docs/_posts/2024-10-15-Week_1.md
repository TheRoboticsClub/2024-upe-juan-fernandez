## The JdRobot Internship Blog

In this blog I will write everything I learn in my internship in JdRobot. More entries will be added each week.

## GitHub Pages

GitHub pages hosts websites directly from a GitHub repository, it's been used for this blog. To create one:

1. **Create a repository**:
    Create a new repository in GitHub. The name of the repository should be `your-username.github.io`, replace `your-username` with your GitHub username. The site will be available at `https://your-username.github.io`.

2. **Configure your GitHub Pages**:
    Go to your repository settings and the Pages section. In Build and deployment, select Deploy from a branch and select the branch and folder used as a publishing source (in my case, the main branch and docs folder). After a few minutes, your site will be live and you can access it.

From there, you can add more content to your website. You can also use custom designs for your website, maintained in other repositories.

## Robotics Academy for users

I installed the user version of Robotics Academy first, following these [instructions](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/user_guide/). I installed it on two different PCs, one with Windows and the other with Linux (Ubuntu). I didn't encounter any problems in the installation of this versión.

## Robotics Academy for developers

For the developers version, I followed these [steps](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/blob/humble-devel/docs/InstructionsForDevelopers.md).
In this one, I had some errors when trying to use the site. To solve them I had to install npm and yarn.

```bash
nvm use 16
nvm install-latest-npm
npm install -g yarn
```

After that, I could use the developer version without errors.

```bash
cd <dir>/RoboticsAcademy
sh scripts/develop_academy.sh
```

## Testing exercises

I also tested the performance of the exercises, I might update this section later if I test more.
